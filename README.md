# Music Mixer Assignment
## by Amie C

The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and
ultimately design and build a multimedia application using design and motion tools
as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your team will implement drag and drop
functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger
animation, and play a compiled audio track (see www.incredibox.com as a
reference).

## Project Design

Six songs shall be selected, represented by an icon. When the user drags the icon to a player, the player will then list the corresponding song and play it, starting from the beginning of the song.

The Play button will start the song sequence.
The Pause button will pause the song sequence.
The Stop button will stop the song and rewind it to the beginning.

If a new song is added while others are playing then all songs are rewound to start from the beginning.
